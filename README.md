# Zod Crash Course

This Zod crash course will give you everything you ever needed to know about [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) - an amazing library for building type-safe AND runtime-safe applications.

## Quickstart

```sh
# Installs all dependencies
yarn install

# Starts the first exercise
yarn exercise 01
```

## How to take the course

First, start up the [video on YouTube](TODO).

You'll notice that the course is split into exercises. Each exercise is split into a `*.problem.ts` and a `*.solution.ts`.

To take an exercise:

1. Go into `*.problem.ts`
2. Run `yarn exercise 01`, where `01` is the number of the exercise you're on.

The `exercise` script will run TypeScript typechecks and a test suite on the exercise.

This course encourages **active, exploratory learning**. In the video, I'll explain a problem, and **you'll be asked to try to find a solution**. To attempt a solution, you'll need to:

1. Check out [Zod's docs](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)
2. Try to find something that looks relevant.
3. Give it a go to see if it solves the problem.

You'll know if you've succeeded because the tests will pass.

**If you succeeed**, or **if you get stuck**, unpause the video and check out the `*.solution.ts`. You can see if your solution is better or worse than mine!
